This is a copy of TOPS made by Hallvar Haugdal: https://github.com/hallvar-h/TOPS/

This is a version made in my master's thesis, adapted to easily study the Nordic 45 (N45) model - a dynamic model for the Nordic synchronous area.
This version has laid the groundwork for further research on N45, with a script that easily adapts for different time scenarios.
